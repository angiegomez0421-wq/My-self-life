      <h2>Featured Post 1: Work-Life Balance: From Pallets to Passion</h2>
      <p>My routine as a trainee at Dispapeles S.A.S. is demanding. Every day, I am using the WMS to track the inventory of paper and cardboard. I have to ensure that the Inventory Accuracy KPI is above 98.5%. It's a precise job that requires focus!</p>
      <p>However, I don't just work. My main hobby is cycling.</p>
      <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/276517/pexels-photo-276517.jpeg" alt="Person cycling">
      <p>If I had more time, I would join a local cycling team. My family is my biggest supporter. My dad always says, "A balanced life is the most efficient operation." Last weekend, we visited our relatives in the countryside.</p>
      <table>
        <tr><th>My Life Aspect</th><th>English Tense/Structure</th><th>Example</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Work Routine</td><td>Present Continuous / Modals</td><td>"I am monitoring shipments." / "I must check quality."</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Hobbies & Dreams</td><td>Conditional Sentences</td><td>"If I win the lottery, I will buy a new professional bike."</td></tr>

      <h2>Featured Post 2: Critical Thinking & Media Literacy in the Supply Chain</h2>
      <p>In Logistics, information is currency. Critical Thinking helps us determine if a source is reliable. We shouldn't just believe the first transportation quote we receive!</p>
      <p>Media Literacy is vital when reading logistics news:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Analyze the Source:</strong> Is the report about cost reduction published by an independent financial analyst or by the company itself?</li>
        <li><strong>Look for Bias:</strong> Headlines often use sensational language. A headline like, "Warehouse Disaster Causes Global Price Spike" might be hiding the fact that the company had already been facing mismanagement issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Reference Data:</strong> I apply this daily when comparing a carrier's promised delivery time (media/claim) with their actual performance data (reality).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> We must use critical thinking to filter operational news and avoid making expensive decisions based on biased information.</p>

      <h2>Featured Post 3: Crime and Punishment: Securing Our Paper Assets</h2>
      <p>Cargo theft and internal fraud are serious threats to Dispapeles. Our products, like specialized paper rolls, are valuable, making us a target.</p>
      <p><strong>The Crime:</strong> The most common crime is pilferage (small thefts) or intentional damage to hide inventory errors.</p>
      <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> We use robust security cameras and a Trazability System. Every employee has to scan the product location and their ID.</p>
      <p><strong>Punishment:</strong> If an employee is caught committing fraud, they will be immediately terminated and legally prosecuted.</p>
      <p><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong> Strict controls and a clear understanding of legal consequences are essential for supply chain security.</p>

      <h2>Featured Post 4: My Ideal Trip: Singapore, the Logistics Hub</h2>
      <p>My greatest interest is to travel to Singaporeâ€”the heart of Asian logistics. I have been saving money for two years, and I hope to go next year.</p>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Travel Plan</th><th>English Structure</th><th>Reason</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Before I go</td><td>Future Perfect</td><td>"By next June, I will have completed my English B2 level."</td></tr>
        <tr><td>While I am there</td><td>Present Continuous</td><td>"I am planning to visit the Tuas Mega Port."</td></tr>
        <tr><td>My dream activity</td><td>Conditional Sentence (Type 2)</td><td>"If I could speak perfect English, I would negotiate a port tour."</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>This trip will be a fantastic chance to practice the Present Perfect ("I have never seen a port that big!") and expand my global logistics vocabulary.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="post">
      <h2>Featured Post 5: My English Learning Progress</h2>
      <p>My English journey has been challenging but rewarding. I used to struggle with Past Perfect and Conditional Sentences.</p>
      <p><strong>What I can do now (B1.1+):</strong> I can discuss my job responsibilities clearly. I can write a formal complaint email if a shipment is late.</p>
      <p><strong>My Future Goal:</strong> I will focus on using more complex modal verbs (ought to, should have, might have) to suggest operational improvements in my final project for Dispapeles.</p>
      <p>I have noticed a significant improvement in my listening skills after watching logistical webinars without subtitles!</p>

      <h2>Suggested Post 6: Green Logistics: A Current Affair</h2>
      <p>The global move toward Green Logistics is a major current affair. Dispapeles has to comply with environmental regulations. Our challenge is reducing the carbon footprint of our paper transportation.</p>
      <p>If we had switched all our trucks to electric models, the cost of operations would have been much lower in the long run.</p>
      <p>We must investigate more sustainable packaging options, like light wood or biodegradable plastic, even if they are currently more expensive.</p>
